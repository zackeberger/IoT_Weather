Source files for programs meant to be run on Beaglebone. Configured with a temperature sensor and button, the beaglebone,
the device will be able to read temperatures and be turned on/off. A beaglebone is not required to run the programs and
see the basic functionality.

Build with 'make', clean executables with 'make clean'. Automated test harness for local_prog run with 'make check'.

Notes
* local_prog.c compiles to a program, local_prog, that does not involve any network communication. It is easier to configure and use.
* tcp.c compiles to a program, tcp, that extends local_prog.c for network communication with a server sending requests.
* tls.c compiles to a program, tls, that extends tcp.c to to involve encrypted communication.

* tls.c requires OpenSSL library as a dependency
