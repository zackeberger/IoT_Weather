<H2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:</H2>
<P>
Write a program (called <tt>local_prog</tt>) that:
<ul>
   <li> builds and runs on your embedded system.</li>
   <li> uses the AIO functions of the MRAA library to get readings from your temperature sensor.</li>
   <li>	samples a temperature sensor at a configurable rate (defaulting to 1/second, and controlled
   	by an optional <tt>--period=</tt># command line parameter that specifies a sampling 
	interval in seconds).</li>
   <li> converts the sensor value into a temperature.  By default, temperatures should be
        reported in degrees Fahrenheit, but this can be controlled with an optional
	<tt>--scale=C</tt> (or <tt>--scale=F</tt>) command line parameter.</li>
   <li> creates a report for each sample that includes:
   	<ul>
	   <li>	time of the sample (e.g. <tt>17:25:58</tt>) in the local timezone</li>
	   <li> a single blank/space</li>
	   <li> a decimal temperature in degrees and tenths (e.g. <tt>98.6</tt>)
	   <li> a newline character (<em>\n</em>)
	</ul></li>
   <li> writes that report to the stdout (fd 1).</li>
   <li> appends that report to a logfile (which it creates on your embedded system) if that logging has been enabled
   	with an optional <tt>--log=</tt><em>filename</em> parameter.</li>
   <li> uses the GPIO functions of the MRAA library to samples the state of the button 
   	(from your Grove sensor kit) and when it is pushed ...
   	<ul>
	   <li> outputs (and logs) a final sample with the time and the string <tt>SHUTDOWN</tt> 
	   	(instead of a temperature).</li>
	   <li> exits</li>
	</ul>
   </li>
   <li> Your program can assume that the sensors are connected as recommended by the Grove
        documentation.
   </li>
</ul>
</p>
<P>
Note that we want you to use MRAA AIO/GPIO functions to access your sensors, and not the (more powerful
and convenient) Grove library functions.  The Grove library hides all of the details of embedded I/O, 
sampling and signal interpretation, but only works for the Grove Sensors.  
We want you to get experience with direct control of and access to the digital and analog I/O pins.
</P>
<P>
Many people have observed that the recommended calibration constants appear to be off by
ten degrees or more.  Every sensor (including the ones that will be used when we grade your submissions)
seems to read differently.
</p>
<P>
The time returned from <em>localtime(3)</em> will only be in the correct timezone if you have
correctly configured the local timezone on your embedded system.
</P>
Extend your program to (in parallel with generating reports) accept the following commands from stdin:
<ul>
   <li> <tt><strong>SCALE=F</strong></tt><br>
   	This command should cause all subsequent reports to be generated in degrees Fahrenheit.
   </li>
   <li> <tt><strong>SCALE=C</strong></tt><br>
   	This command should cause all subsequent reports to be generated in degrees Centegrade
   </li>
   <li> <tt><strong>PERIOD=</strong></tt><em>seconds</em><br>
   	This command should change the number of seconds between reporting intervals.
	It is acceptable if this command does not take effect until after the next
	report.
   </li>
   <li> <tt><strong>STOP</strong></tt><br>
   	This command should cause the program to stop generating reports, but continue
	processing input commands.
	If the program is not generating reports, merely log receipt of the command.
   </li>
   <li> <tt><strong>START</strong></tt><br>
   	This command should cause the program to, if stopped, resume generating reports.
	If the program is not stopped, merely log receipt of the command.
   </li>
   <li> <strong><tt>LOG</tt></strong> <em>line of text</em><br>
     	This command requires no action beyond logging its receipt
	(the entire command, including the <tt>LOG</tt>).
        In project 4C, the server may send such commands to help 
	you debug problems with your reports.
   </li>
   <li> <tt><strong>OFF</strong></tt><br>
   	This command should, like pressing the button, output (and log) a time-stamped <tt>SHUTDOWN</tt> message 
	and exit.
   </li>
</ul>
<P>
All received commands will be terminated by a new-line character ('<em>\n</em>').
Note that when your program is tested (by the sanity checker or grading program)
stdin will not be a console, but a pipe.  
A single read may return a partial line or multiple lines.
Make sure that your program buffers and lexes its input,
and does not assume that one call to <em>read(2)</em> will return one command.
</P>
<P>
Nothing special needs to be done about strange combinations of commands:
<UL>
   <li> a <tt>START</tt> when you are already started is a no-op.</li>
   <li> a <tt>STOP</tt> when you are already stopped is a no-op.</li>
   <li> it is not expected that a <tt>STOP</tt>, <tt>PERIOD</tt>,
   	or <tt>SCALE</tt> command
        will force out a report whose time as not yet come.</li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
If logging is enabled, all received commands (valid or not)
should be appended to the log file (exactly as
received, with no timestamp) but not displayed to standard output.  A sample log is 
shown below:
</p>
<pre><tt>
	11:37:41 98.6
	11:37:42 98.6
	11:37:43 98.6
	PERIOD=5
	11:37:44 98.6
	11:37:49 98.6
	11:37:54 98.6
	SCALE=C
	11:37:59 37.0
	11:38:04 37.0
	STOP
	START
	11:38:19 37.0
	11:38:24 37.0
	OFF
	11:38:27 SHUTDOWN
</tt></pre>
<P>
If you are typing commands to your program, you may see the echos interspersed with 
temperature reports.  This is unimportant, because they should be correctly distinct
in your log, and when we test your submission, the input will becoming from a program
rather than a console.
</P>
<P>
The sanity check script will send a series of commands to your program, and some
implementations process all the commands before generating any reports.  To make
sure this doesn't happen, you should generate your first report before you start
processing input commands.  Again, this will not be an issue during testing because
there will be delays between the commands when we test your program.
</P>
<P>
You could implement this program with separate threads for sensor polling and command processing,
but the computation associated with each operation is so small that you may find it much simpler
to use a single thread (and polling or non-blocking I/O) to avoid hanging on standard input for
commands that only rarely arrive.  A poll system call cannot tell you that the button has
been pushed, but GPIO pin read is a non-blocking operation, so you can simply read the button
status periodically.  If your interval between reads is too long, the button may be pressed
and released before you can read its status.  To avoid this problem, you can either use
a short polling interval or arrange for an interrupt/signal when the button is pushed.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate development and testing you might find it helpful to write your program to support a 
(<tt>-DDUMMY</tt>) define whose special code includes mock implementations for the <tt>mraa_aio_</tt> and 
<tt>mraa_gpio_</tt> functionality. Doing so will enable you to do most of your testing on your regular computer.  
When you are satisfied that it works there, modify your Makefile, run the command "<tt>uname -r</tt>", and check for the 
presence of the string "<tt>beaglebone</tt>" in the resulting output. If it is not found, build with a rule
that passed the <tt>-DDUMMY</tt> flag to <em>gcc</em>.
</p>

<H2>Project Extension (Networking):</H2>
<H3>Part 1: Communication with a Logging Server</H3>
<P>
Write a program (called <tt>tcp</tt>) that:
<ul>
   <li> builds and runs on your Beaglebone.</li>
   <li> is based on the temperature sensor application you built previously
        (including the <tt>--period=</tt>, <tt>--scale=</tt> and <tt>--log=</tt> options).
   </li>
   <li> accepts the following (mandatory) new parameters:
       <ul>
        <li><tt>--id=</tt><em>9-digit-number</em></li>
        <li><tt>--host=</tt><em>name or address</em></li>
        <li><tt>--log=</tt><em>filename</em></li>
        <li><em>port number</em></li>
    </ul>
       Note that there is no <tt>--port=</tt> in front of the port number.
          This is a non-switch parameter.
   </li>
   <li> accepts the same commands and generates the same reports as the
       previous Beaglebone project, but now the input and output are from/to
    a network connection to a server.
       <ol type="1">
        <li> open a TCP connection to the server at the specified address and port</li>
        <li> immediately send (and log) an ID terminated with a newline:<br>
            <strong><tt>ID=</tt></strong><em>ID-number</em>  <br>
            This new report
            enables the server to keep track of which devices it has received
            reports from.
        </li>
        <li> as before, send (and log) newline terminated temperature reports over the connection </li>
        <li> as before, process (and log) newline-terminated commands received over the connection<br>
            If your temperature reports are mis-formatted, the server will return
            a <strong><tt>LOG</tt></strong> command with a description of the
            error.<br>
            Having logged these commands will help you
            find and fix any problems with your reports.
        </li>
        <li> as before, the last command sent by the server will be an <strong><tt>OFF</tt></strong>.<br>
             Unlike the previous project, the button will not be used as an
             alternative manual shutdown mechanism.
        </li>
    </ol>
       <P>
       Do not accept commands from standard input, or send received commands or generated
       reports to standard output.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li> As before, assume that the temperature sensor has been connected
         to Analog input 0.</li>
</ul>
The ID number (passed with the initial <strong>ID=</strong> command) will appear in the TCP server log
(follow the
<a href="serverinfo.html">TCP server URL</a>),
and will permit you to find the reports and server-side logs for your sessions.
It is vitally important that the <strong>ID=</strong> string you send to the server (in your first report)
be identical to the value (passed to your client) in the <tt>--id=</tt> command line argument.
If they are not identical, the sanity-check and grading scripts will be unable to find
the reports from your session(s) and will assume that your program did not work.
</P>
<P>
If the server receives incorrect reports from you it will send back LOG
messages describing the errors.
</P>
<p>
To protect your privacy, you do not have to use your student ID number, but merely
a nine-digit number that you will recognize and that will be different from the
numbers chosen by others.
</p>
<P>
From the server status page, you will also be able to see, for each client,
a log of all commands sent to and reports received from that client in the
most recent session.  If the server does not like your reports, it may be due
to garbage (typically null) characters.  If the problem with your reports is
not obvious, examine the server log in an editor that will display non-graphical
characters.
</p>
<P>
As in Project 4B, to facilitate development and testing you might find it helpful to write your program to, if compiled with a special
(<tt>-DDUMMY</tt>) define, include mock implementations for the <tt>mraa_aio_</tt> and
<tt>mraa_gpio_</tt> functionality. Doing so will enable you to do most of your testing on your regular computer.
When you are satisfied that it works there, modify your Makefile run the command "<tt>uname -r</tt>", check for the
presence of the string "<tt>beaglebone</tt>" in that output, and if not found, build with a rule
that passed the <tt>-DDUMMY</tt> flag to <em>gcc</em>.
</p>


<H3>Part 2: Authenticated TLS Session Encryption</H3>
<P>
Write a program (called <tt>tls</tt>) that:
<ul>
   <li> builds and runs on your Beaglebone</li>
   <li> is based on the remote logging appliance build in part 1</li>
 <!--
   <li> accepts the following additional command line parameter:
       <ul>
    <li><tt>--serverkey=</tt><em>key file</em> for server's public key</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
 -->
   <li> operates by:
       <ol type="1">
        <li> opening a TLS connection to the server at the specified address and port
             <!-- and authenticating the server against a supplied
                 <a href="lab4c_server.crt">certificate</a>.
             If the server
             does not use the expected certificate, log an error (to both
             standard error and to the log), close the connection, and exit.-->
        </li>
        <li> sending (and logging) your student ID followed by a newline </li>
        <li> sending (and logging) temperature reports over the connection </li>
        <li> processing (and logging) commands received over the connection </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
</ul>
The ID number will appear in the TLS server log
(follow the
<a href="serverinfo.html">TLS server URL</a>),
and will permit you to find the reports for your sessions.
</p>
